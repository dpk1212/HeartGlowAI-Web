## 🔁 Structure of the HeartSteps Module

### ✅ 1. Relationship Plans (7, 10, 15, 30 Days)

Each HeartStep plan is a pre-designed or personalized roadmap. The plan includes:

*   Daily AI-generated messages or emotional actions
*   Short coaching insights
*   Optional journaling or reflection prompt
*   Adaptive pacing (can skip, delay, retry)

**Plan Types (with Examples):**

*   **Repair After a Fight (7 days)** — Rebuild trust through short, vulnerable messages
*   **Reconnection Starter (10 days)** — Gradual ice-breakers for long-lost friends or siblings
*   **Daily Affection Builder (15 days)** — Sustain warmth and care in romantic partnerships
*   **Tough Love with Care (5 days)** — Set healthy boundaries or give feedback professionally
*   **Unsent Messages for Closure (7 days)** — Write but don't necessarily send what you feel
*   **Pre-Grief Letters (10 days)** — Messages for aging parents or those with illness
*   **New Relationship Warmth (7 days)** — Early-phase romantic partners or deepening friendships
*   **Post-Breakup Healing (10 days)** — A guided self-to-other processing journey
*   **Emotional Safety Builder (Family)** — Slowly build courage to talk about difficult topics

Each plan increases in emotional depth and provides meaningful structure.

### 💬 2. Persistent Chat Interface (GlowCoach)

The heart of HeartSteps is the GlowCoach — a chat-based, emotionally intelligent companion.

GlowCoach is experienced as a living thread. It creates emotional continuity, giving users a single supportive voice throughout the plan.

**Coach Behaviors:**

*   Welcomes user by name and plan context
*   Tracks emotional tone preference and pace
*   Offers message ideas or edits based on user feedback
*   Adjusts tone: "Want to make this softer?" or "Need something lighter today?"
*   Provides gentle reminders or check-ins
*   Explains "why this message works"

**Chat Examples:**

*   **Day 1 (Plan: Reconnect with Estranged Brother)**
    *   🧠 **GlowCoach:** "Welcome, and thank you for being brave enough to start this. �� Let's begin gently."
    *   💬 **Prompt:** "Hey. I know it's been a while. I've been thinking about how we used to talk."
    *   🧠 **Coach Insight:** "This message acknowledges emotional presence without pressure or expectation."
    *   *User options:*
        *   ✅ \[Send as is]
        *   ✍️ \[Edit message]
        *   🔁 \[Try a different version]
        *   💤 \[Not today]

*   **Day 3 (Plan: Daily Affection Builder - Romantic)**
    *   🧠 **GlowCoach:** "Let's remind them how much they're seen today."
    *   💬 **Prompt:** "I noticed how you helped your friend the other day. You always show up for people. I love that about you."
    *   🧠 **Coach Insight:** "Tiny acknowledgments build emotional trust and nurture intimacy."

*   *If a message doesn't land:*
    *   🧠 **GlowCoach:** "Totally okay. 💛 Want to try a lighter tone or take a day off?"

*   *Reflection Prompt (Optional):*
    *   "What was it like to say that today?" → \[Textbox]

### 📅 3. Plan Tracking + Feedback

*   **Daily Status Options:** ✅ Completed, 💤 Skipped, 🔁 Retried
*   **Progress UI:** Progress bar, calendar view, or streak count
*   **Feedback Buttons Per Message:**
    *   😊 "Felt good to send"
    *   😐 "Neutral"
    *   😔 "Didn't land well"
    *   📤 "Haven't sent yet"
*   **Reflection Entry (optional):**
    *   "Do you want to remember how this felt?" → \[Save Note]
*   **History View:** Users can review past messages, feedback, and emotional notes
*   **Smart Suggestions:** "You skipped Step 4 — want to replace it with something softer?"
