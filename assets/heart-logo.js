// This is a placeholder file for heart-logo.png
// In a real implementation, we would generate this file using a graphics tool
// or by rendering the SVG to a canvas and exporting as PNG

/*
The heart-logo.png should be a heart-shaped logo with circuit board patterns inside.
It should use a gradient from pink (#FF3B7F) to cyan blue (#0AB5FF).
The heart shape has circuitry lines and nodes inside, as shown in the screenshots.
This logo appears in the app header and on the login screen.
