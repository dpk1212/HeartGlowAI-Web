# HeartGlowAI Assets

This directory contains asset files for the HeartGlowAI React Native application.

## Required Assets

The application requires the following assets:

1. **heart-logo.png** - The HeartGlowAI heart-shaped logo with circuit board design
2. **icon.png** - App icon (1024x1024) with the HeartGlowAI logo
3. **splash.png** - Splash screen with the HeartGlowAI logo and name
4. **adaptive-icon.png** - Adaptive icon for Android with the HeartGlowAI logo
5. **favicon.png** - Favicon for web (16x16) with the HeartGlowAI logo
6. **screenshots.png** - Combined screenshots for the README

## Generating Assets

The `heart-logo.svg` file contains the vector version of the heart logo. Use the following steps to generate the required PNG assets:

1. Open the `convert-assets.html` file in a web browser
2. Use the download buttons to save each asset
3. Place the downloaded files in this directory
4. Ensure the filenames match those listed above

## Design Guidelines

All assets should follow these design guidelines:

- **Color Scheme**: Use gradient from pink (#FF3B7F) to cyan blue (#0AB5FF)
- **Background**: Dark background (#050A14) for icons and splash screen
- **Logo Design**: Heart shape with circuit board patterns inside
- **Typography**: Clean, modern font for text elements (San Francisco or similar)

The application's visual identity is built around the futuristic, tech-focused heart logo that symbolizes the merging of technology (circuit patterns) and human emotion (heart shape).
