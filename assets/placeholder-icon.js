// This is a placeholder file for icon.png
// In a real implementation, we would generate this file using a graphics tool

/*
The icon.png should be a 1024x1024 PNG file with the following properties:
- Dark background (#050A14)
- Heart-shaped logo with circuit board patterns inside
- Gradient from pink (#FF3B7F) to cyan blue (#0AB5FF)
- The heart should be centered with proper padding

This icon will be used for the app icon on iOS and Android devices.
