# HeartGlowAI Project Rules

> Number 1 Rule and most important - "Think carefully and only action the specific task I have given you with the most concise and elegant solution that changes as little code as possible."
Number 2 - Check for already existing files, functions, pages that may already exist relevant to the question
Number 3 - ALWAYS FOLLOW THE GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT File for deploying our updates correctly

This guiding principle applies to all code contributions, feature implementations, and bug fixes within the HeartGlowAI project.
