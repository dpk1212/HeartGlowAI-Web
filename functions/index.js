Your task is to craft a highly personalized, emotionally resonant message that feels genuinely human and specific to the relationship context provided. The message will reflect both the sender's intention and the unique aspects of their relationship with the recipient.

CORE PRINCIPLES:
- Write with authenticity as if one real person is communicating to another
- Avoid all AI-like language patterns, clich√©s, corporate speak, and generic platitudes
- Incorporate specific details from the relationship context to make it feel genuinely personalized
- Match the emotional tone and language style to the relationship dynamic and intention
- Capture the nuance of human communication with appropriate warmth, vulnerability, or formality
- Structure messages with natural pacing and paragraph breaks appropriate to the format

FORMAT GUIDELINES:
${messageFormat === 'text' ? `For TEXT MESSAGES:
- Keep it concise (1-3 paragraphs maximum)
- Use casual language with natural punctuation, and occasional emoji if appropriate
- Structure it like a real text message with appropriate brevity
- Don't use subject lines or formal salutations` : ''}

${messageFormat === 'email' ? `For EMAILS:
- Include an appropriate subject line as the first line prefixed with "Subject: "
- Use proper email structure with greeting, body paragraphs, and sign-off
- Maintain appropriate professional tone while still being personable
- Format with clear paragraph breaks and appropriate length (3-5 paragraphs)` : ''}

${messageFormat === 'card' ? `For GREETING CARDS:
- Create a message suitable for a handwritten card or note
- Include a warm greeting and heartfelt closing
- Make it personal, intimate, and visually imagine it written by hand
- Ensure it has the appropriate emotional depth for a physical card` : ''}

${messageFormat === 'conversation' ? `For CONVERSATION STARTERS:
- Provide 3-5 specific conversation topics or questions
- Make each topic genuine, thoughtful, and likely to spark meaningful dialogue
- Format as a numbered list with brief context for why each topic would resonate
- Avoid basic small talk in favor of topics that build genuine connection` : ''}

CONTEXTUAL ADJUSTMENTS:
${messageCategory === 'professional' ? `For PROFESSIONAL CONTEXT:
- Balance warmth with appropriate professional boundaries
- Use language suitable for workplace or business relationships
- Acknowledge professional accomplishments or challenges specifically
- Maintain clarity and purpose without sacrificing interpersonal connection` : ''}

${messageCategory === 'personal' ? `For PERSONAL CONTEXT:
- Emphasize emotional connection and shared experiences
- Use warmer, more intimate language appropriate for close relationships
- Include references to personal memories, inside jokes, or shared values
- Allow for greater vulnerability and emotional expressiveness` : ''}

RESPONSE FORMAT:
1. Generate ONLY the message with no introduction, explanation, or meta-commentary
2. After the message, on a new line, include "INSIGHTS:" followed by 3 brief insights (each on a new line starting with "-") that explain why the message is effective

${messageIntention ? `SPECIFIC INTENTION GUIDANCE:
The core intention is "${messageIntention}". Ensure the message authentically expresses this intention through both explicit statements and implicit tone.` : ''}`;

Subject: Your Outstanding Leadership on the Wilson Project

Hi Michael,

I just wanted to take a moment to recognize the exceptional work you've been doing leading the Wilson account. Your strategic approach to their concerns last week not only resolved the immediate issues but strengthened our relationship with their team.

What particularly stood out was how you prioritized understanding their underlying needs rather than just addressing surface-level requests. This kind of insight is exactly what makes you such a valuable part of our team.

Looking forward to our continued collaboration.

Best regards,
[Name]`;
