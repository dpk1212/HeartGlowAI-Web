# HeartGlow AI Dashboard Access Guide

The HeartGlow AI Dashboard is hosted on GitHub Pages and is accessible at:

```
https://heartglowai.com/dashboard/
```

## Access Details

- The dashboard is a separate application from the main HeartGlow AI landing page
- It can be accessed by directly navigating to the URL above
- No automatic redirection is in place to preserve the main landing page experience

## Testing the Dashboard

For testing purposes, you can:

1. Access the dashboard directly by entering the URL in your browser
2. Bookmark the dashboard URL for quick access
3. Create internal links on the main site that open the dashboard (but aren't prominently featured)

## Deployment Information

The dashboard is deployed to the `/dashboard` directory on the GitHub Pages site. This approach allows:

- Independent deployment of the dashboard without affecting the main site
- Development and testing of new dashboard features in isolation
- Future integration options when the dashboard is ready for public use

## Troubleshooting Access Issues

If you encounter problems accessing the dashboard:

1. Verify you're using the correct URL (https://heartglowai.com/dashboard/)
2. Check that the deployment was successful (see deployment logs)
3. Clear browser cache if you've accessed previous versions
4. Try accessing from an incognito/private browsing window
