// This is a placeholder file for favicon.png
// In a real implementation, we would generate this file using a graphics tool

/*
The favicon.png should be a 16x16 or 32x32 PNG file with the following properties:
- Heart-shaped logo with circuit board patterns
- Gradient from pink (#FF3B7F) to cyan blue (#0AB5FF)
- Simple enough to be recognizable at a small size

This icon will be used as the favicon for the web version of the app.
*/

// Please create a favicon.png file based on the screenshots and place it in this directory
